Develop a C++ program that simulates a card dealer at a casino. Your program will randomly select a card from a deck and present it with a professional, casino-style format.
Specific Formatting Requirements for Casino-Style Card Display:

    Output Dimensions:
        Width: All output should be contained within a fixed width of 40 characters.
        Borders: Use '*' to create top and bottom borders that span the entire width.
        Spacing: Ensure that there is a single line of space above and below the card description.

    Card Description:
        Alignment: The card description should be centered as closely as possible within the output.
        Label and Value: The card type (e.g., "Casino Card:") should be left-aligned, and the specific card (e.g., "Ace of Spades") should be right-aligned on the same line.

    Typography:
        Fill Character for Empty Spaces: Use '-' for filling any gaps between the label and the card value within the line.
        Text Style: Use standard console text. Ensure no additional styling like bold or italic is used since these are not supported by standard console output.
